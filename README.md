## Inspiration  
💫 Ever wonder how many hidden gems you’ve scrolled past just because of a bad review? 💫
Taste is as personal as a love story—what didn’t spark joy for one person might just be your next culinary romance. ❤️ Maybe that bad review came from someone who doesn’t appreciate spice, or they missed out on the restaurant’s real star dish. Don’t let someone else’s opinion dim your dining adventures! Trust your cravings, take the leap, and let your taste buds write their own love letter to food. 🍷🍝✨
Life’s too short for boring meals—go taste the magic for yourself! 💕🔥

## What it does
💖🍓✨ Calling all foodies! ✨🍓💖

Bestie, imagine never having to guess where to eat ever again—because your meals are literally made for you! 💅✨ Our web app is like your personal foodie fairy godmother, taking your exact taste preferences—saltiness, sweetness, spiciness, sourness, and umaminess—(yes, we’re that detailed, queen 👑) and matching them to five perfect restaurants near you.

No more scrolling through endless reviews written by people who clearly don’t get your vibe. We cut through the noise and pick spots that actually match your flavor profile. Feeling spicy? 🌶️ We got you. Craving something sweet? 🍰 Say less. Need that umami hit? 🍜 Chef’s kiss, babe.

✨ Because why settle for mid meals when you can have a dining experience that’s so you? Let’s eat like the main characters we are. 💖🍽️👛

## How we built it
💖✨ How We Built This Foodie Dream ✨💖

Bestie, this wasn’t just thrown together—it’s a handcrafted, chef’s kiss masterpiece of tech and taste. Here’s how the magic happens:

🍭 Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—because aesthetics matter, and we love a sleek, user-friendly experience. 💅✨

🔥 Backend: Running on Flask & Python, serving up your custom foodie matches with speed and precision. Think of it as your personal chef, but make it ✨code✨.

🍽️ Database: We’re keeping all that delicious data safe and sound with PostgreSQL, hosted on Supabase (because only the best for our foodie girlies 💖).

📍 External APIs: We sprinkled in some Google Maps magic so you can find your perfect restaurant match without breaking a sweat. Effortless and iconic.

💡 Basically, we built the ultimate bestie who just knows where you should eat. You’re welcome. 😉🍓✨

## Challenges
🌸 Challenges We Faced 🌸
APIs can be so unpredictable sometimes 🥲 We had to make sure everything stayed functional and didn’t randomly break on us. Debugging was a journey, but we powered through like champs! 💪✨

## Accomplishments
🌟 Accomplishments We’re Proud Of 🌟
We actually got everything working smoothly—frontend, backend, database, and Google Maps all talking to each other like besties. It wasn’t easy, but we made it happen, and honestly? We’re feeling pretty unstoppable. 😌🔥

## What We Learned
💡 What We Learned 💡
Full-stack development? Check.
How Git actually works? Finally, yes.
APIs? No longer scary.
We even picked up a new language—PostgreSQL—because why not add more skills to our resume? 😌✨

All in all, this was a major glow-up moment for us. 💖🚀
